In order to generate the images in ../ you need to open these .svg files in
inkscape.

For each image you want to export you need to click on the white bounding box
for that image.  This box marks the 'selection' area that will exported/generated.

Next click on:

File -> Export Bitmap

This brings up a dialog box.  Make sure that 'selection' is chosen.  This will
only export the selected diagram.

Click Filename and enter [<path/to/powerabi/graphics>/<filename>.png].

Then click [Export].  This needs to be done for each image you want to
regenerate.
