Introduction
============

This is the DocBook source for the Power Architecture
32 bit Application Binary Interface Supplement for Linux.

How to generate the documentation
=================================

In order to build the ABI PDF file you need to have the following
software installed:

* OpenJade version 1.3 (version 1.4 dumps core on this document.)
* DocBook DSSSL stylesheets (we use version 1.79.)
* docbook-utils

Run the following command to generate a draft version of the specification:

    ./MAKE.sh --unified --draft --wrapper

You will get the following file in the current directory:
`Draft-Power-Arch-32-bit-ABI-supp-1.0-Unified.pdf`.
